# facile-api
## Introduction
***facile*** means ***easy*** and this is how an API specification, especially for small- to mid-size-APIs should be.
This project origins from pure minimalism and *lazyness* to not spin up swagger et.al. each time when a simple REST-API should be created.

## What to expect

The main part of this specification is the API-response although payload spec and general conventions shall follow.
Goal is to have a solid foundation for simple yet descriptive API responses.
